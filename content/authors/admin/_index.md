I am a a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology's School of Cybersecurity and Privacy where I am advised by Professor Joseph Jaeger. My interests include cryptography, information security, and generally, theoretical computer science. My most recent work focuses on provable security in the memory-aware setting. I am a part of The Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM), an initiative that promotes women in mathematics.
