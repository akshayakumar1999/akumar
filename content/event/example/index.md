abstract: >
  We give the first examples of public-key encryption schemes which can be
  proven to achieve multi-challenge, multi-user CCA security via reductions that
  are tight in time, advantage, and memory. Our constructions are obtained by
  applying the KEM-DEM paradigm to variants of Hashed ElGamal and the
  Fujisaki-Okamoto transformation that are augmented by adding uniformly random
  strings to their ciphertexts and/or keys.

  The reductions carefully combine recent proof techniques introduced by Bhattacharyya’20 and Ghoshal- Ghosal-Jaeger-Tessaro’22. Our proofs for the augmented ECIES version of Hashed-ElGamal make use of a new computational Diffie-Hellman assumption wherein the adversary is given access to a pairing to a random group, which we believe may be of independent interest.
